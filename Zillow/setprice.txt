<b><u>Setting a Price:</u></b><br><br><b>How to Set a List Price for Your Home</b><br>Setting the list price for your home involves evaluating various market conditions and financial factors. During this phase of the home selling process, your REALTOR&#174; will help you set your list price based on:<ul type="disc"<li>pricing considerations</li><li>	comparable sales</li><li>market conditions</li><li>offering incentives</li><li>	estimated net proceeds</li></ul><br><b>Pricing Considerations &#8211; Find a Balance Between Too High and Too Low</b><br>When setting a list price for your home, you should be aware of a buyer&#39;s frame of mind. Consider the following pricing factors:<br>If you set the<b> price too high</b>, your house won&#39;t be picked for viewing, even though it may be much nicer than other homes on the street. You may have told your REALTOR&#174; to &#34;Bring me any offer. Frankly, I&#39;d take less.&#34; But compared to other houses for sale, your home simply looks too expensive to be considered.<br>If you <b>price too low</b>, you&#34;ll short&#8211;change yourself. Your house will sell promptly, yes, but you may make less on the sale than if you had set a higher price and waited for a buyer who was willing to pay it.<br>TIP: Never say &#34;asking&#34; price, which implies you don&#39;t expect to get it.<br><br>&#39;
<b>Price Against Comparable Sales in Your Neighborhood</b><br>No matter how attractive and polished your house, buyers will be comparing its price with everything else on the market.<br><br><b>Your best guide is a record of what the buying public has been willing to pay in the past few months for property in your neighborhood.</b>REALTOR&#174; can furnish data on sales figures for those comparable sales and analyze them to help you come up with a suggested listing price. The decision about how much to ask, though, is always yours.<br><br><b>Competitive Market Analysis (CMA): </b>
The list of comparable sales a REALTOR&#174; brings to you, along with data about other houses in your neighborhood that are presently on the market, is used for a &#34;Comparative Market Analysis&#34; (CMA). To help in estimating a possible sales price for your house, the analysis will also include data on nearby houses that failed to sell in the past few months, along with their list prices.<br><br><b>A CMA differs from a formal appraisal </b>in several ways. One major difference is that an appraisal will be based only on past sales. Also, an appraisal is done for a fee while the CMA is provided by your REALTOR&#174; and may include properties currently listed for sale and those currently pending sale. For the average home sale, a CMA probably gives enough information to help you set a proper price.<br><br><b>Formal Written Appraisal:</b>A formal written appraisal (which may cost a few hundred dollars) can be useful if you have unique property, if there hasn&#39;t been much activity in your area recently, if co&#8211;owners disagree about price or if there is any other circumstance that makes it difficult to put a value on your home.<br>
TIP: If you do order a market value appraisal, make it clear you don&#39;t need an elaborate, or full narrative report, i.e., the kind that&#39;s complete with photos of the house and neighborhood. Floor plans and a site map is sufficient in most cases.<br><br><b>Market Conditions &#8211; Is it a Buyer&#39;s Market or a Seller&#39;s Market?</b><br>A CMA often includes a Days on the Market (DOM) value for each comparable house sold. When real estate is booming and prices are rising, houses may sell in a few days. Conversely, when the market slows down, average DOM can run into many months.<br>Your REALTOR&#174; can tell you whether your area is currently in a buyer&#39;s market or a seller&#39;s market. In a seller&#39;s market, you can price a bit beyond what you really expect, just to see what the reaction will be. In a buyer&#39;s market, if you really need to sell promptly, offer an attractive bargain price.<br><br><b>If You Price High, Set a Schedule for Lowering the Price</b><br>Some sellers list at the rock&#8211;bottom price they&#39;d really take, because they hate bargaining. Others add on thousands to the estimated market value &#34;just to see what happens.&#34; If you want to try that, and if you have the luxury of enough time to feel out the market, sit down with your REALTOR&#174; and work out an advance schedule for lowering the price if need be.<br>If there haven&#39;t been many prospects viewing your home after three weeks, you may need to lower your list price. If that doesn&#39;t bring any prospective buyers, you may need to lower your list price again. Plan on doing that regularly until you find a level that attracts buyers. Make a written schedule in advance, before emotion takes over and you&#39;re tempted to dig your heels in.<br><br><b>Offering Incentives to Hasten a Sale</b><br>Sometimes cash incentives are as effective as lowering the price, especially in the lower price range where buyers may be &#34;cash poor.&#34; You may offer to pay some or all of a buyer&#39;s closing costs and discount points required by the buyer&#39;s lending institution.<br>If you haven&#39;t had much traffic through your house and you&#39;re in a hurry to sell, you may want to add the offer of a bonus to the selling broker, in addition to their commission. An example of the wording for such an offer may be &#39;to the broker who brings a successful offer before Christmas.&#34;<br><br><b>Estimating Net Proceeds</b><br>Once you&#39;ve been given an estimate of market value by your REALTOR&#174;, you can get a rough idea of how much cash you might walk away with when the sale is completed. This can be particularly useful when you start looking for another home to buy.<br>To estimate your net proceeds, from the estimated sales amount, subtract the applicable costs in the three sections outlined below: seller&#39;s costs, buyer&#39;s/seller&#39;s costs and closing costs.<br><br><b>Seller&#39;s Costs:</b>Subtract the following costs as applicable.<ul type="disc"<li>payoff figure on your present loan(s)</li><li>broker&#39;s commission</li><li>prepayment penalty on your mortgage</li><li>	attorney&#39;s fees</li><li>unpaid property taxes</li></ul><br><br><b>
Buyer&#39;s/Seller&#39;s Costs: </b>Additionally, your REALTOR&#174; can tell you whether local customs or rules dictate whether the buyer or seller pays for the items listed below. Subtract the following costs, as applicable.<br><ul type="disc"t<li>	title insurance premium</li><li>transfer taxes</li><li>	survey fees</li><li>inspections and repairs for termites, etc</li><li>	Homeowner Association transfer fees and document preparation</li><li>	home protection plan</li><li>natural hazard disclosure report</li><li>	recording fees</li></ul><br><b>Closing Costs:</b>As far as closing costs are concerned, you and your eventual buyer may agree on any arrangement that suits you, no matter what local practice &#39;dictates. Your REALTOR&#174; will assist you in estimating what your final closing costs will be.
